# Mental wellbeing evidence and gap map

This app will soon (likely by the end of March 2025) be published to the [Public Health Scotland website](https://publichealthscotland.scot/population-health/mental-health/prevention-of-mental-ill-health-and-improved-wellbeing/mental-health-evidence-and-addressing-gaps/)

## Structure of the app

* Run the app by opening app.R and clicking 'Run' in the top right hand corner
* `setup.R` contains required packages and is where any data should be read in
* `data` is a folder for storing data to be read in (not available on GitHub). This data is processed in the data_preparation_mental_wellbeing script.
* `www` contains the app stylesheets and PHS icon images
* `modules` contains a module which covers most of the app functionality
* `functions` contains R scripts with functions for the app
